      computations that are involved in everyday life, but provided humans with the ability
      to understand mathematics on a greater scale than ever imagined.

      This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner.
      Calculations which were previously cumbersome and time-consuming can now be done in minutes or
      even seconds, all at the push of a few buttons.
