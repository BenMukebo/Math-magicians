      Calculators have not only greatly enhanced our ability to perform the regular
      computations that are involved in everyday life, but provided humans with the ability
      to understand mathematics on a greater scale than ever imagined.
      Calculations which were previously cumbersome and time-consuming can now be done in minutes or
      even seconds, all at the push of a few buttons. Without calculators, advanced math courses,
      such as Calculus, would require much longer class-times and reformatted lesson plans.
      Calculators, when used alongside a comprehensive mathematics curriculum,
      increase the quality and quantity of student learning

      This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner.
      Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote
      more time in understanding the problem. Secondly, they are saved from monotonous calculations
      and the same boring mundane procedure. One type of number trick involves adding, subtracting,
      multiplying, or dividing by a starting number and subtracting the original number in such
      a way that each participant always arrives at a certain number: Think of a number between
      1 and 100. Multiply your number by 4. Add 12.
